# Superflow

*Pre-Requisites*

**Superflow** is a package that analyzes susyNt so it is assumed that the **SusyNtuple** package is already checked out in your working directory. 

**Superflow** can also be configured for making fake ntuples and computing charge-flip probability ~out-of-the-box and so requiries the necessary packages in order to be compiled. These can be checked out by running sourcing the script locaged in *Superflow/scripts/get_superflow_dep.sh*

At the moment this checks out two packages:

1. **DileptonMatrixMethod**

    Package written by Davide Gerbaudo (Davide.Gerbaudo@cern.ch) to calculate fake efficiencies, etc... located at [github.com/gerbaudo/DileptonMatrixMethod](https://github.com/gerbaudo/DileptonMatrixMethod)
